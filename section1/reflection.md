## Section 1 Reflection

1. Regarding the blog posts in Part A, how do you feel about asking questions? Do you tend to ask them too soon, or wait too long, or somewhere in between?

   I like the rule of setting a timer for 20minutes of looking before asking a question.  I tend to wait too long, and end up down the rabbit hole of google, eventually too lost to even recognize where I started. This is something that I will really focus on improving.

2. What are the data types you learned about in this section? In your own words, define each.

   The data types are string, number, and boolean.
   * String data consists of letters and characters that are wrapped in quotes, either single or double, just as long as the front and back quotes are the same. Numbers can also be wrapped in quotes to make them string data.
   * Number data is the data type that handles all numbers, including negative numbers and decimals (floating point numbers). Large numbers are written with no comma.
   * Boolean data types evaluate to one of two values:
     1. True
     2. False
     Comparison operators may be used in the variable name.

3. How would you log the string `"Hello World!"` to the console?

   console.log("Hello World!");

4. What is/are the character(s) you would use to indicate comments in a JavaScript file? What is the purpose of a code comment?

   Code comments are used to add information for other developers. They can be used for instructions or to indicate the purpose of some code. It can also be used to de-activate parts of code that you want to temporarily keep from running.
   //Text after 2 backslashes is a single line comment.
   //Anything that follows 2 backslashes
   //Will be ignored by JavaScript.

   /* This can be used for multi-line comments */

5. In your own words, what is a variable? How would you explain it to a 5 year old?

   A variable is a temporary value used to store bits of information in order for certain code to do its job. Data stored in a variable can change, and once you leave the page, the browser will forget any information it holds.  

6. Think of a site or app you use frequently. What are three variables that are probably used? Which data type would each of those variables probably hold?

  An app I use frequently is Momentum Dash. It is a productivity app and three variables that I think they would use would be:
  1. var time to display the current time on the screen. This would be a string data type.
  2. var dailyQuote This would also be a string data type, as it is a sentence on the screen
  3. var checkBox This would be a Boolean data type, indicating is it is true or false that the checkbox is checked off.

7. In your own words, explain what concatenation is.

   Concatenation means to join together, so it is joining together words, phrases, numbers, and variables in a continuous line. The independent parts of the string are joined together with a plus sign (+)

8. Think of a site or app you use frequently. Where do you think the developers used concatenation?

  When I sign up to volunteer for something at my kids' school, we use SignUp Genius, where first and last names are put inputted separately. When submitting for confirmation of what you signed up for, I would think that they use a form of concatenation to show the completed submission form, with first and last names together, as well as volunteer task choice.

9. What questions do you still have about the work we've done so far? (not having a question is not an option)

  Is there an instance where concatenation is preferred to interpolation? Why?
