## Section 3 Reflection

1. In Section 3, we removed even more supports and pushed you to learn a bit more independently, read through technical documentation, and use your resources more. How did that feel?

    It was actually very empowering to learn how to look up some of these things and find that I understand what I am reading. I appreciate the help and resources that are provided, and even helping me know where to look for more resources.

2. Think of a web or mobile application you use regularly. Where is an example of a place that the developers probably use Arrays? Explain.

    Pandora music is an app I use quite frequently. I would imagine that arrays are used in this app when listing out playlists, or even radio stations based on lists of genres.

3. In your own words, explain what an Array method is.

    Array methods are functions built in to Javascript that can be applied to arrays to perform a change or calculation to the array. The array methods prevents from having to redo the array every time there is a change. Methods include adding or removing elements, removing or adding elements from the front or back of the array. Elements can also be sorted, or reversed.

4. What is the purpose of a loop? When we would use a loop in conjunction with array vs. without?

    A loop is a function that is used to perform tasks based on a condition. The conditions will typically return true or false, and the loop will continue to run until the defined condition returns false.
    A loop can be used with an array to loop through the elements in the array, such as evaluating a list of grades as pass or fail, until the list has been exhausted.
    A loop can also be used for repeated tasks, used with If/else statements. So the loop with will until the if/else statement returns as false.

5. If you had to teach a 5 year old about loops, how would you explain it?

    A loop is a function that tells you do a task repeatedly until there is no more task to do, such as telling you to pick up your toys. The function will continue to repeat until all the toys are picked up, then it will stop because the condition has been met.

6. What questions do you still have about Arrays and loops?

    If the array literal is the preferred method over array constructor, is there ever an instance when using array constructor would be more appropriate/effective?
